# PNG Geothermal Solutions - Physics Project  

## Project Overview  
This website showcases our physics project exploring geothermal energy as a sustainable power solution for Papua New Guinea (PNG). Our team, **"Three and a Half Men,"** investigates PNG's significant geothermal potential, current energy challenges, and practical solutions for implementation.  

## Website Development by Sarveshwar Senthil Kumar  
This website was designed and developed by **Sarveshwar Senthil Kumar**, a member of our team, using modern web technologies to create an engaging and informative experience.  

### Key Contributions:  
âœ… **Front-End Development** â€“ Built using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** for a responsive and interactive layout.  
âœ… **UI/UX Design** â€“ Implemented a clean, visually appealing interface with geothermal-themed colors and smooth animations.  
âœ… **Interactive Elements** â€“ Added 3D card effects, floating animations, and smooth scrolling for better user engagement.  
âœ… **Responsive Layout** â€“ Ensured compatibility across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
âœ… **Content Organization** â€“ Structured the information logically for easy navigation and readability.  

### Technologies Used:  
- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure and content layout  
- **CSS3** â€“ Styling, animations, and responsive design (Flexbox & Grid)  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Basic interactivity and scroll effects  
- **Google Fonts & Font Awesome** â€“ Typography and icons  
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control and deployment

## Project Significance  
Papua New Guinea has:  
- **3,000-4,000 MW** of untapped geothermal potential  
- Only **13% electrification rate** currently  
- **55 known geothermal areas**  
- Heavy reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels  

Our project demonstrates how geothermal energy could:  
âœ… Provide **reliable, affordable electricity** nationwide  
âœ… Reduce dependence on **imported fuels**  
âœ… Create **local jobs and economic opportunities**  
âœ… Support **sustainable development goals**
